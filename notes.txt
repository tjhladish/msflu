Discussion points - Tom - 13/7/2016

Possible changes:

CODE:
1. 2 R0 values
Mean of the 2 R0 values as parameter, then ratio of R0s is also estimated
So mean is X and ratio is 1 (or 1.2, etc)
Tom thinks then that you can have a 95% CI on the ratio, and see if it includes 1
might require arbitrarily setting one R0 to be bigger at the beginning

2. Static populations - recalculated networks. To avoid problems with RAM.

3. Add 2015/16 season - Roz to download and send.

4. Possibly a relationship between prob of reporting, and susceptibility, i.e. that they’re proportional, and the more susceptible you are, the likelier you are to report. perhaps to estimate a linear relationship, and estimate the parameters of mx + c. What distribution?

5. Autocorrelation metric of average # of years between above median epidemics.

PLOTS:
Try changing bins on R0 dist to see if it’s actually bimodal
Make more example figures of epi sizes by year for chosen particles, just to have a look at.
Bin sizes of histograms - make them the same
Pairs plot of SMC set 12.

INTERPRETATION:
Re: reporting fraction. Not very identifiable. Probably there’s an effect of differential spreading, i.e. lower transmission from asymptomatic people.


# Was discussed
All cities the same because all networks the same
do we need actually to run multiple sized cities?
Are these the right metrics? More on autocorrelation?
Distribution for CCI?

Discussion with Tom 23-8-2015:

To Do:
1. Static network, so computer does not have to regenerate networks every time
2. Have same sequence of cluster jumps in each place
3. Have a non-flu ILI fraction in each place. binomially distributed non-flu ILI. -- DONE
4. Add new autocorrelation metric
5. Maybe… Have 2 R0 values, as in previous Meeting notes

The justification is that there is some non-flu reporting that will inflate ILI in each place
Mean ratio of consecutive attack rates

Roz to re-send new data without 2015 typo.
Tom to implement 1, 2, 3 and 4, and to think about 5.
